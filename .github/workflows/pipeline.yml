The error you're encountering, `pytest: command not found`, indicates that `pytest` is not installed in your environment. To fix this issue, you need to ensure that `pytest` is listed in your `requirements.txt` file or installed as part of the CI workflow.

### Solution:

1. **Ensure `pytest` is in `requirements.txt`:**
   - Add `pytest` to your `requirements.txt` if it's not already listed:
     ```
     pytest==<version>  # Use the latest version or a specific one
     ```

2. **Alternatively, install `pytest` in the workflow:**
   If you prefer not to add `pytest` to your `requirements.txt`, you can modify your GitHub Actions workflow to install it separately. Here's how to do it:

### Updated GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on push to the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on pull requests to the main branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.11  # Use the version your application requires

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Install pytest
      run: |
        pip install pytest  # Installing pytest

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest  # Run pytest to test your FastAPI app

    - name: Build FastAPI app
      run: |
        echo "Building FastAPI app..."
```

This will ensure that `pytest` is available in the GitHub Actions environment before running your tests. Let me know if this resolves the issue!
